  <p>AI-powered brain imaging enhances precision in neurological diagnosis and treatment, helping clinicians detect subtle abnormalities and guide personalized therapy (Gong et al., 2025).</p>

  <p>AI Treatments in Neurology: Transforming Brain Health</p>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing neurology, the branch of medicine dedicated to the study and treatment of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. From improving diagnostics to personalizing treatments and accelerating drug development, AI is becoming an indispensable tool in modern neurological care (Bösel et al., 2025; Kalani & Anjankar, 2024).</p>

  <h2>Understanding AI in Neurology</h2>
  <p>AI refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence—such as pattern recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving. In neurology, AI applications range from analyzing complex imaging data to predicting disease progression and assisting in treatment planning (Berger, 2024). Major AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, all of which enable algorithms to detect intricate patterns in large datasets (Zhang, 2025).</p>

  <h2>Applications of AI in Neurological Care</h2>
  <p>One of the earliest and most transformative uses of AI in neurology is neuroimaging. AI algorithms can enhance MRI and CT scan resolution, detect subtle abnormalities, and automatically segment structures like grey matter, white matter, and lesions (Advances of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging, 2025). In emergency neurology, AI rapidly identifies time-sensitive conditions such as ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, guiding urgent clinical decisions (AbuAlrob & Mesraoua, 2024).</p>

  <p>AI extends beyond diagnosis by predicting disease progression and optimizing personalized treatments. By integrating patient history, imaging, and genetic data, AI can forecast changes in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy (Zhang, 2025). Adaptive technologies like AI-assisted deep brain stimulation modulate therapy in real time based on neural activity (Bösel et al., 2025).</p>

  <p>In rehabilitation, AI platforms tailor motor or cognitive exercises for stroke and traumatic brain injury recovery, refining difficulty based on patient performance (Berger, 2024).</p>

  <p>AI also accelerates drug discovery for neurological disorders. Machine learning models can simulate molecular interactions, predict a compound’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, and identify potential therapeutic targets (Kalani & Anjankar, 2024).</p>

  <p>AI-driven studies are increasingly used to discover compounds that promote neural regeneration and repair, offering new hope for neurodegenerative and post-injury recovery (Systematic Review: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Neuroregeneration, 2025).</p>

  <p>In critical care, AI systems provide continuous, real-time neurological monitoring. These tools can identify subtle signs of deterioration and integrate imaging, laboratory, and clinical data to support rapid diagnosis and intervention in ICU settings (AbuAlrob & Mesraoua, 2024).</p>

  <p>Generative AI and large-scale data integration are opening new frontiers in neurology. For example, synthetic brain imaging can support model training while protecting patient privacy (Advances of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging, 2025). Large language models assist clinicians by summarizing lengthy medical histories, generating reports, and highlighting key research to guide evidence-based care (Integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence in ADRD, 2025).</p>

  <h2>Benefits of AI in Neurology</h2>
  <p>AI offers numerous advantages in neurological care, including faster dataset analysis, improved diagnostic accuracy, enhanced monitoring of disease progression, and expanded access to specialized tools in under-resourced settings (Bösel et al., 2025). These technologies support clinical decision-making, help detect diseases earlier, and reduce the burden on healthcare systems by improving efficiency (Berger, 2024).</p>

  <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
  <p>Despite its potential, AI faces several challenges. The quality and diversity of training data strongly influence model accuracy; biased datasets risk producing unreliable or inequitable outcomes (Kalani & Anjankar, 2024). Many algorithms function as “black boxes,” meaning that although they can generate accurate predictions, the internal decision-making process is not easily understood by clinicians or researchers.</p>

  <p>This lack of transparency makes it difficult to determine why an AI system reached a particular conclusion, raising concerns about interpretability and trust in high‑stakes clinical settings (Berger, 2024). Ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, informed consent, and AI governance remain central to responsible clinical implementation (Bösel et al., 2025).</p>

  <h2>Future Directions</h2>
  <p>The future of AI in neurology is highly promising. Predictive analytics may allow clinicians to detect neurological disorders before symptoms appear, enabling earlier and more effective interventions (Zhang, 2025). AI‑driven therapies, such as adaptive neurostimulation, are expected to become more precise and responsive (Bösel et al., 2025).</p>

  <p>Drug discovery will likely accelerate as computational models grow more advanced, and ethical frameworks will evolve to ensure the safe and equitable use of AI in medical settings (Kalani & Anjankar, 2024). Ultimately, AI is positioned to significantly enhance the quality, efficiency, and global accessibility of neurological care.</p>
