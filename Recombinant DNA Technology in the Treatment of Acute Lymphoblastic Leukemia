  <h1>Recombinant DNA Technology in the Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</h1>
  <p><em>Moon Hoang · Oncology Editor in Chief at Revitalised Medicine</em></p>

  <p>DNA mutations cause cancer, but with engineered DNA, modern therapies have become highly targeted. Recombinant DNA technology is playing a pivotal role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), enabling precise interventions at the molecular level.</p>

  <h2>Therapeutic Proteins via Recombinant DNA</h2>
  <p>Recombinant DNA technology allows the production of specific proteins that target leukemia cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells. Key examples include:</p>

  <h3>Recombinant Erwinia L-Asparaginase</h3>
  <p>Depletes asparagine, which is essential for leukemia cells’ survival, inducing apoptosis in malignant cells.</p>

  <h3>Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2)</h3>
  <p>Boosts the immune system, enhancing T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells.</p>

  <h3>Blinatumomab</h3>
  <p>A bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that directs the patient's T-cells to attack leukemia cells expressing CD19, offering targeted therapy with reduced systemic toxicity.</p>

  <p>These recombinant therapies represent a major shift in oncology, moving away from non-specific chemotherapies towards precision medicine, improving outcomes and reducing adverse effects.</p>
