  <h1>What Is Multiple Myeloma?</h1>
  <p><em>Moon Hoang · Oncology Editor in Chief at Revitalised Medicine<br>8 October 2025</em></p>

  <p>Having cancer can weaken one’s bones, and that is seen in multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer triggering abnormal protein overproduction. Over time, these proteins accumulate and cause the bone to fracture (Myeloma – Multiple Myeloma – Causes, Symptoms, Stages, Prognosis).​</p>

  <p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer occurring in plasma cells (a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies and plays an important role in the immune system). In this condition, the cancerous plasma cells will divide uncontrollably and overproduce abnormal antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) called monoclonal proteins (M‑protein) (What is multiple myeloma? 2025).​</p>

  <p>Multiple myeloma begins forming in the bone marrow, where plasma cell buildup overwhelms normal blood cell development, and they also secrete chemicals, stimulating other cells to weaken bones, leading to lytic lesions (Multiple Myeloma: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2025). As the condition progresses, the abnormal plasma cells escape from the bone marrow and metastasize to other areas of the body (Multiple Myeloma: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2025).​</p>

  <p>In general, there are two subtypes of multiple myeloma: hyperdiploid (a less aggressive condition affecting forty‑five percent of multiple myeloma patients, where abnormal plasma cells have more chromosomes than usual) and non‑hyperdiploid (an aggressive condition characterized by an unusually low number of chromosomes in myeloma cells and responsible for forty percent of multiple myeloma cases) (8 Types of Multiple Myeloma, 2025).​</p>

  <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
  <p>While the multiple myeloma subtypes provide insight into disease progression, understanding its genetic causes is equally important. However, multiple myeloma etiology is not entirely clear — it is suggested that patients with a condition termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) may develop multiple myeloma (Multiple Myeloma – Symptoms and Causes – Mayo Clinic, 2024). MGUS is a benign condition where the M‑protein level in blood is low (Multiple Myeloma – Symptoms and Causes – Mayo Clinic, 2024).​</p>

  <p>Other risk factors include old age (prevalent in those aged 60 and above), male sex, being Black, and having a family history of this condition (Multiple Myeloma – Symptoms and Causes – Mayo Clinic, 2024). In 2023, the 5‑year survival rate for multiple myeloma was 59.8% with 35,730 estimated new cases and 12,590 estimated deaths (Vicencio, 2024).​</p>

  <h2>Symptoms & Complications</h2>
  <p>Early‑stage multiple myeloma clinical manifestations are not obvious. Still, as the disease progresses, patients may experience bone pain (in the spine, chest and hips), nausea, and constipation (Multiple Myeloma – Symptoms and Causes – Mayo Clinic 2024).​</p>

  <p>Additionally, multiple myeloma patients are at risk of developing anemia (low level of hemoglobin) due to myeloma cell count overtaking that of healthy red blood cells in the bone marrow or hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium) resulting from calcium leaking from damaged bone — excessive blood calcium levels lead to serious conditions, such as comas or heart attacks (Bernstein, 2025).​</p>

  <p>Furthermore, kidney damage or failure, resulting from monoclonal light chains (abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells) migrating and accumulating in the kidney, is a common complication that fifty percent of multiple myeloma patients experience (Bernstein, 2025 & Ramirez, 2024). These proteins block the tubules (small structures in the kidney that help filter waste) and impair the kidney’s ability to filter waste (Ramirez, 2024). Apart from that, high levels of calcium leading to kidney crystal formation also cause kidney failure (Ramirez, 2024).​</p>

  <h2>Treatment Approaches</h2>
  <p>Early‑stage multiple myeloma does not require treatment, but the patients will be monitored closely by healthcare providers. When the cancer progresses, doctors will design a treatment plan based on the patient’s age and tumor aggressiveness.​</p>

  <p>Like in many cancers, chemotherapy is primarily used in multiple myeloma treatment, where drugs are prescribed in mixtures. Drugs used in this treatment are bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, liposomal doxorubicin, melphalan and vincristine (Multiple Myeloma: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2025).​</p>

  <p>Alternatively, targeted therapies present an effective option specifically targeting certain proteins or genes in developing myeloma cells. Some medications include monoclonal antibodies (drugs aiding the immune system in detecting cancer cells) and proteasome inhibitors (drugs blocking the proteasome from degrading proteins, leading to the abnormal protein accumulation in myeloma cells, which will induce apoptosis in cancer cells) (Multiple Myeloma: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2025).​</p>

  <p>Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs, a novel therapy that restricts tumor growth and strengthens immune system activation, diversify therapeutic options for multiple myeloma (El‑Sayed, n.d.). These drugs can also be used synergistically with other treatments to enhance patient outcomes while reducing high‑toxic‑agent dosages (El‑Sayed, n.d.). Common immunomodulatory drugs used in therapy are lenalidomide, pomalidomide and thalidomide (Multiple Myeloma: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment, 2025).​</p>

  <p>Regardless of the treatment approach, patients will experience side effects. To address this issue, corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone and prednisone) are combined with chemotherapy to reduce those side effects (nausea and vomiting) (Smith, 2023). When used alone, the drug relieves damage and inflammation in infected areas while destroying myeloma cells (Smith, 2023).​</p>

  <p>Even though the molecular origin and cure for multiple myeloma remain unclear, ongoing research and therapeutic innovation, such as immunomodulatory drugs and synergistic combination therapies, are increasing treatment specificity for cancer cells and minimizing side effects on surrounding healthy cells. Moving forward, research into the molecular basis of this condition will be crucial in achieving personalized and lasting treatments.</p>
