<h1>Stem Cell Therapy: A New Hope for Mucopolysaccharidosis III and Pediatric Neurological Diseases</h1>
<p><em>By Edha Talwar · Neurology Staff Writer at Revitalised Medicine</em></p>

<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome, is a rare inherited lysosomal disorder characterized by progressive neurological degeneration due to accumulation of heparan sulfate. Stem cell therapy offers a promising new avenue for treatment, particularly in pediatric patients, by potentially restoring missing enzymes and repairing neural tissue.</p>

<h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>MPS III is caused by genetic defects that impair enzymes responsible for breaking down glycosaminoglycans, resulting in their accumulation in neurons and other cells. Early stages show subtle developmental delays, but symptoms typically progress to severe neurodegeneration, behavioral disturbances, and cognitive decline.</p>

<h2>Stem Cell Approaches</h2>

<h3>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</h3>
<p>HSCT involves transplanting donor-derived stem cells that can produce functional enzymes. While effective in some lysosomal disorders, the results in MPS III are limited if performed after significant neuronal loss.</p>

<h3>Neural and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)</h3>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) and genetically corrected iPSCs can differentiate into neurons and glial cells, supplying missing enzymes and supporting repair. Preclinical models show reduction in substrate accumulation and improvements in neural function.</p>

<h3>Gene-Enhanced Stem Cells</h3>
<p>Stem cells genetically modified to express the missing enzyme prior to transplantation may improve outcomes and ensure sustained production within the CNS. Autologous iPSC-based therapies are being explored to minimize immune rejection.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blood–Brain Barrier:</strong> Delivering cells to the CNS remains a major challenge.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Early intervention is critical for efficacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Risks include immune reactions and tumorigenicity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stem cell therapy represents a promising frontier for MPS III and similar pediatric neurological diseases. Continued research and clinical trials are essential to develop safe, effective treatments capable of halting or reversing neurodegeneration in affected children.</p>
